CompVis with noise

Scripts are intended to run on google colab without any additional requirements. Usage of a GPU runtime is strongly advised.

# Patches

Currently we use a local patch of mantik that allows to set the `env_manager=local` argument in the start submission.

# How to run

- Get colab pro
- Start colab
- Go to terminal
- install mantik with mlflow extension
- export mantik credentials
- use mantik local run from colab command line
